# Google OAuth Verification Guide for Spotto

## ‚úÖ What I've Created

1. **Privacy Policy Page** - `/privacy-policy`
   - Comprehensive privacy policy covering data collection, usage, and user rights
   - Accessible at: `https://spotto-iota.vercel.app/privacy-policy`

2. **Terms of Service Page** - `/terms-of-service`
   - Complete terms covering user accounts, acceptable use, payments, and legal requirements
   - Accessible at: `https://spotto-iota.vercel.app/terms-of-service`

3. **Updated Footer** - Added links to both pages in the landing page footer
   - Links appear in both the main footer section and bottom copyright area
   - Uses proper React Router navigation

## üìã Verification Requirements Checklist

- ‚úÖ App name: "Spotto"
- ‚úÖ App logo: 120x120px (created)

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline

- **Verification Review**: 1-4 weeks typically
- **Custom Branding**: Shows after verification approval
- **Internal Apps**: Immediate custom branding (requires Google Workspace)

## üîß Alternative: Internal App (Immediate Solution)

If you have Google Workspace and want immediate custom branding:

1. Change **User Type** from "External" to "Internal"
2. This requires a Google Workspace organization
3. Internal apps show custom branding immediately without verification
4. Limited to users in your organization

## üìû Contact Information

Update these email addresses in the legal pages before deploying:
- Privacy Policy: `privacy@spotto.app`
- Terms of Service: `legal@spotto.app`
- Support: Use your actual support email

## üéØ What This Achieves

Once verified, users will see:
- "Spotto" instead of generic app name
- Your custom logo on the OAuth consent screen
- Professional, trustworthy appearance
- Compliance with Google's requirements

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Don't change scopes** after submitting for verification
2. **Keep contact information updated** - Google communicates via email
3. **Test thoroughly** before submitting
4. **Be patient** - verification can take several weeks

The enhanced login forms I created will show your Spotto branding immediately, while the Google OAuth consent screen will show custom branding after verification approval.
